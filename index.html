      <em><b>Reshma Saujani, New York
Lawyer, politician and founder/CEO, Girls Who Code</b><br> Girls are raised to be perfect, boys are raised to be brave. Because of this we forget how to speak up for ourselves. Bravery is a muscle you gotta keep exercising,” Saujani declared at a 2016 TED Talk. The bravery deficit, she believes, is the reason why women are underrepresented in STEM. A graduate of Yale Law School, Saujani began her career as an attorney and activist and, in 2010, became the first Indian American woman to run for US Congress. But her most successful project began on the campaign trail when she noticed the gender gap in computing classes. “To truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half of our population,” Saujani explains. This led her to start Girls Who Code, a non-profit organisation working to empower women in tech. Today, 88 per cent of alumni have declared a CS major/minor and by the end of 2018 they will have reached out to 50,000 girls across the US.

      <em><b>Deepa Madhavan, Chennai
Director, Enterprise Data Services, Paypal</b><br>One of the first things that Madhavan mentions about PayPal is ‘Recharge’—a programme that brings women back to work. After working with Deloitte in San Francisco, she took a break to raise her three children. “I know the struggle, because I traversed the same journey,” she says, emphasising how such programmes help women transition back to work. According to her, tech-related sectors will be defining “what the world looks like in the future.” She also champions initiatives like ‘Girls in Tech’ and ‘Unity’, a women’s affinity group at PayPal that helps women network, build leadership skills and find mentorship.

      <em><b>Ashwini Asokan, Chennai
Founder and CEO, Mad Street Den</b><br>Asokan worked at Intel Labs in California, but left in 2013 to start Mad Street Den, an AI and computer vision company with teams in San Francisco and Chennai. Her focus is now on bringing AI out of the lab and into everyday life. For instance, the company announced a breakthrough technology that analyses clothing and generates an image of the garment on a person of any skin colour, size and shape. Mad Street Den is also one of the few firms where women employees comprise 58 per cent of the staff. “Through our internships, we’ve helped women change career tracks and enter the workforce… Companies underestimate the impact of training and what it can do for building a motivated and high-performing team,” she says.

      <p class="card-text">"Being a woman in tech is about having and fostering courage—in ourselves and others, to go after the unconventional, untried, and crazy ideas. In my preteen years, I became aware that certain activities or jobs were less acceptable for girls. I was curious and energized by the constraint. I explored technology because I loved the way it could change the way we do things and create new learning opportunities. I never saw it as a space that girls and women shouldn’t explore and I hope to encourage parents, kids and adults to consider it too."</p>

      <p class="card-text">“Being a woman in tech, in general, is both challenging and rewarding. It's still challenging because we've still not closed the gender gap in this field, but at the same time is rewarding to see how things are going in the right direction. Each individual woman can make a difference with the right attitude. The attitude that says: "I am a professional and my gender has nothing to do with my job. My experience has been the best so far, I've had the great opportunity to be supported, guided and helped by wonderful people, regardless of their gender, and at some point, I stopped seeing myself as a "woman in tech", but a "leader in tech".</p>

      <p class="card-text">“Being a woman in tech means educating parents and businesses what they should have been taught from the beginning: how to protect themselves and their assets online. Too many people and businesses are losing what matters most to them simply because they didn't learn how to properly secure their online environments. They won't do it because they think "It's too complicated!" Or "I don't need it. I'm not at risk!" The truth is it's as complicated as you make it and everyone is a bigger risk than they believe.”
